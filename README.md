DM: Andy confirmed today:

Final deliverables should be:
- one slide deck, no more than 9 slides
- one technical Jupyter Notebook that has an emphasis on readability
- if you have additional data cleaning or functions that you don't want to include in your final technical notebook, put it in a python file and import that file into your notebook
- your README.md file should be and overview of your repository itself: a description of the files and folders inside of your repository, and the purpose of the repository
