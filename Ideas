Parking lot to keep record of ideas:
1) Need to see the two data sets
2) Research other possible data sets on https://www.kaggle.com
3) Check if youtube.com or vimeo.com have anything on movie rank-ordering


4) data from Andy:
    - rt data sets are pretty much text strings with reviews -- Isuggest we dont use them at all
    - tn-movie_budgets great data set: Release date, Title, Budget, Domestic Sales, Worldwide Sales
        -- Check data - sometimes sales ==0, sometime Domestic Sales =- Worldwide Sales, budgets form $425 KK to 0 drop below cutoff
